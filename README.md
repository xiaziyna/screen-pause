# Screen Pause

Pause a part of the screen and drag it around. No need to bother resizing windows. Handy if you're writing and need to keep checking a reference, or comparing things. 

## Requirements

- Python 3
- XFCE (at the moment this is designed to work only on my computer)

## Install

```bash
./setup_hotkey_mint.sh
```

Default hotkey: `ctrl+alt+p`

## Usage

- Pause a region of the screen with 'ctrl+alt+p'. Simply click and drag. Once paused, you can move the paused screenshot around, hit the 'play' button to release it.
